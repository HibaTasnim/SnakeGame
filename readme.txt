1.To develop a Game

2.A snake eating food game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around a game board, collecting food items while avoiding obstacles such as walls and the snake's own body.

 For a project based on this game, the objective would be to develop a functional and engaging version of the game using a programming language such as JavaScript.

 The game would involve the following components:

 A game board or screen on which the snake and food items are displayed
 A snake that moves in response to user input
 Food items that the snake can collect to increase its score and grow in size
 Obstacles such as walls or other hazards that the snake must avoid
 A scoring system that keeps track of the player's progress
 An end condition, such as when the snake collides with a wall or its own body, that triggers the end of the game
